# Personal Summary

This is a bit of a Frankenstein project for me. I've made something, picked it apart, scrapped it, swapped new code snippets, scrapped it again and rinse repeat. But finally I've managed to fix it to a point I feel it isn't a broken mess.

Thanks to my buddy Theodor for providing help (both recommendations and code)
